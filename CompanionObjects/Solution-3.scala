// 3. Add a field for Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) initialized to 2.3.
// Add the supplied method calories. Where did you put the field?
// Where did you put the method? If you didnâ€™t put them in the
// companion object, do so now. Did you have to make any changes
// to do so? Satisfy the following tests:
// def calories(lbs:Int, mins:Int,
//  mph:Double=3):Long = math.round(
//  (MET * 3.5 * lbs * 0.45)/200.0 * mins
//  )
// val sally = new WalkActivity3
// sally.calories(150, 30) is 82
