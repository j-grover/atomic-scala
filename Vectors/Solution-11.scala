// 11. Create and initialize a List and Set with words, then print each
// one. Try the reverse and sorted operations and see what happens. 

val l1 = List("a", "c", "b")
val s1 = Set("a", "c", "b")

println(l1.reverse, l1.sorted)
// println(s1.reverse, s1.sorted)

// Reverse and sorted are not members of Set
