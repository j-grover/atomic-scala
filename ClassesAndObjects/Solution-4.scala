// 4. Building from Exercise 3, set s2 to "Sam". Do the strings match? If
// they match, print “s1 and s2 are equal.” If they do not match, print
// “s1 and s2 are not equal.” Is s1 still set to "Sally"? 

var s1 = "Sally"
var s2 = "Sam"

if (s1.equals(s2)) println("s1 and s2 are equal")
else println("s1 and s2 are not equal")

println(s1)

// s1 is still set to "Sally"
