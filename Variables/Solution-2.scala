// 2. Create an Int variable (var) named v1 and set it to 5. Update it to 10
// and store in a val named constantv1. Did this work? Can you think
// of how this is useful? 

var v1 = 5
v1 = 10
println(v1)

val constantv1 = v1
println(constantv1)

// This worked, can be useful when no more changes should be made to a variable
